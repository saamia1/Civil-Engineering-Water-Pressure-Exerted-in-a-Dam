# Civil Engineering Case Study Water Pressure Exerted in a Dam

Develop a software solution, which will do the following:
• Present the user with a menu for the different functions the program offers, namely
determining the force on the dam, the forces for a range of water elevations (d1 to d2), or
quit the program.
• In case the user selects the first option (calculating the force on the dam), the program
prompts the user for the respective inputs (D, b, d, and a), validates the user input for every
entry, calculates the force, and displays it on the screen. The program then returns to the
main menu.
• If the user selects the second option, the program prompts the user for all the values needed
to calculate the force for a range of water elevation (including d1, d2, and the step size).
The program prints in a tabular format the water elevation against the force. The program
then returns to the main menu.
• If the user selects the exit option, the program prints a terminating message and quits the
program.
• Note that all constant values must be stored as either symbolic constants or constant
variables.
• You can make additional assumption in case you feel any information is missing. Make
sure to clearly state them.
